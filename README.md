# FRC# 8608 - Programming 101

## To the parents and students: 
this is hyper-accelerated course that is hyper-focused on FRC Java, you and your kid will feel lost at times. each question could be answered with a 4 year degree in Computer science or mathmatics. Do not be discouraged, questions to the mentor show them who is most passionate about their results! 
As a sidenote many of our mentors (this writer included) and students have A.D.D or A.D.H.D and these lesson were wrote with that in mind. many things will be "bullet points" or just list of information so that it is not a "wall of text" that can be overwhelming to many affected students. this will mean you will have to "seek out" information by following links and resources given in each lesson info.

### How to use this? 
read the quickstart laptop guide.rm for more but the process is : 
 1. Setup laptop with NI tools and Wpilib. this will give you the programmers VScode and the Driverstation we use in FRC
 2. Download Github Desktop and Clone the repository so that you have a local copy of everything!
    2.0 you can CLONE the repository or just download the zip and link the repository inside github desktop
    2.1 in Github desktop press branch and "branch" the repository with your own changes! 
 3. in wpilibs VsCode press file->open folder -> and clock on lesson 0 on the repository you just cloned from github!
 4. (in vscode) on the left press explorer (these are the files!) and goto src->frc->java and open StudentLessonInfo.md  
 5. open robot.java (lesson 0) or robotcontainer.java (command based) to start the lesson!
 6. Press F5 to start debugging or Press Simulate robot code to Simulate the robot code!
 7. Show the mentor your results to pass! or update your branch

### struggling? more programming!
maybe you could learn more about computer science and how java works as a programming language. 
we use https://www.codecademy.com/learn/java-introduction for their free course. this will give you a good idea of the language we are speaking when we say we "program in java"
