# FRC# 8608 - Programming 101

## To the parents and students: 
this is hyper-accelerated course that is hyper-focused on FRC Java, you and your kid will feel lost at times. each question could be answered with a 4 year degree in Computer science or mathmatics. Do not be discouraged, questions to the mentor show them who is most passionate about their results! 
As a sidenote many of our mentors (this writer included) and students have A.D.D or A.D.H.D and these lesson were wrote with that in mind. many things will be "bullet points" or just list of information so that it is not a "wall of text" that can be overwhelming to many affected students. this will mean you will have to "seek out" information by following links and resources given in each lesson info.

### How to use this? 
read the quickstart laptop guide.rm for more but the process is : 
 1. Setup laptop with NI tools and Wpilib. this will give you the programmers VScode and the Driverstation we use in FRC

 2. (On this main github page) Scroll to the top and press the big GREEN button named <> code, Then press "open in github desktop"
 2. (IF you did not "open in github desktop") Then (inside github desktop) you can CLONE the repository or just download the zip and link the repository to github
 2. (inside github desktop) press branch and "new branch" and name your branch with your name or nickname (like Joe, bobbyFisher20, or NightRider) this will make a repository with your own changes that wont affect anyone else! 
 5. (in wpiLib VsCode) press file->open folder -> and click on the lesson 0 folder inside the repository you just cloned from github and hit OK!
 4. (in vscode) on the left press explorer (these are the files!) and goto src->frc->java and open StudentLessonInfo.md  
 5. open robot.java (lesson 0) or robotcontainer.java (all other lessons) to start the lesson!

 7. Show the mentor your results to pass! or publish your branch to have your work on github! you're famous!

### struggling? more programming!
maybe you could learn more about computer science and how java works as a programming language. 
we use https://www.codecademy.com/learn/java-introduction for their free course. this will give you a good idea of the language we are speaking when we say we "program in java"
