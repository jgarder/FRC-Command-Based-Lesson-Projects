Here are the Java projects i have been using as student have been doing a 
very FRC centric fast paced race to learn FRC and Java in under 4 years as busy students at their home schools.
everything is wrote in an adult adhd rush so please let me know whats missing or can be improved! 

open robotcontainer.java to see the homework for each lesson.
all these lessons are meant to ran in simulation so they can be used without any additional hardware besides a controller/joystick/ windows Xinput device.
