# FRC# 8608 - Programming 101

## To the parents and students: 
this is hyper-accelerated course that is hyper-focused on FRC Java, you and your kid will feel lost at times. each question could be answered with a 4 year degree in Computer science or mathmatics. Do not be discouraged, questions to the mentor show them who is most passionate about their results! 
As a sidenote many of our mentors (this writer included) and students have A.D.D or A.D.H.D and these lesson were wrote with that in mind. many things will be "bullet points" or just list of information as to avoid a "wall of text" that can be overwhelming. students will have to "seek out" information by following links and resources given in each lesson info. finding/reading documentation is a core part of programming.

### How to use this? 
read the quickstart laptop guide.rm for more but the process is : 
 1. Setup laptop with NI tools and Wpilib. this will give you the programmers VScode and the Driverstation we use in FRC
 2. Download Github Desktop and inside github desktop Clone the repository so that you have a local copy of everything!
 2. (On this main github page) Scroll to the top and press the big GREEN button named <> code, Then press "open in github desktop"
 2. (IF you did not "open in github desktop") Then (inside github desktop) you can CLONE the repository or just download the zip and link the repository to github
 2. (inside github desktop) press branch and "new branch" and name your branch with your name or nickname (like Joe, bobbyFisher20, or NightRider) this will make a repository with your own changes that wont affect anyone else! 
 5. (in wpiLib VsCode) press file->open folder -> and click on the lesson 0 folder inside the repository you just cloned from github and hit OK!
 4. (in vscode) on the left press explorer (these are the files!) and goto src->frc->java and open StudentLessonInfo.md  
 5. (in vscode) open src/java/StudentLessonInfo.rm, to start the lesson read it all!
 6. (in vscode) Press F5 to start debugging or Press Simulate robot code to Simulate the robot code!
 7. Show the mentor your results to pass! or publish your branch to have your work on github! you're famous!

## struggling? Try these options

### Learning the language.
maybe you could learn more about computer science and how java works as a programming language. 
we use https://www.codecademy.com/learn/java-introduction for their free course. this will give you a good idea of the language we are speaking when we say we "program in java" 

### thinking in code
burned out or lost for tonight?, just slow down and think in code instead. this is much easier to pickup and enjoy if you have a busy week, but aslong as you let your mind think through the problems you are learning coding (mindset). for this type of thinking we use brilliant.org! sign up for an account and learn some computer science! https://brilliant.org/courses/thinking-in-code/?from_llp=computer-science

### Try an AP highschool course?
FRC and everything it encompasses should be considered college level. here is a highschoool course that has a different persepctive on computer science. it is another option but we dont recommend starting here.

### Watch some FRC youtube
lets just watch someone teach FRC Java from their perspective, what should you learn? the most important thing is, even though he is programming a different robot, with different codebase and goals, his operation, setup and workflow are all relevant. pay attention or just casually learn but this is a great series to watch

## more frc?
this is the programming info git for 8608, we are building a Cad info git aswell as a media git (the 2 latter will be mostly links and info)
