Lesson 3 - Making complex commands from composing simple commands

This lesson we will take our first

in this we copy lesson 2 to keep our awesome subsystem and simple commands but then we start adding on top of it. 

in this we will be making some simple text print but we will be using complex commands to decide which text to output! if you hold this button but not that button do X, but if holding another button do Y.
we will mainly be using the WPILib code compositon! please read all this and become a pro -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/command-compositions.html
this guide is just a rewriting of the 100% awesome WPILIB docs! please just read the "command based programming" section and you wont even need a mentor! 

the implied 8608 resource is this lesson 3 lesson plan -> N/A yet! coming soon!
if you have no mentor read the wpilib here and replicate this source code on your own! -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/subsystems.html
