  ## FRC #8608 java FRC programming
  #### lesson 005
  
  This guide is just a rewriting of the 100% awesome WPILIB docs! 
  please just read the zero to robot section and you wont even need a mentor! 

  #### WpiLib references used:
    -> Command based programming -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/index.html
    -> binding commands to triggers -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/binding-commands-to-triggers.html#binding-commands-to-triggers
    -> Whiletrue trigger ->  https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/binding-commands-to-triggers.html#whiletrue
    -> CONTROLLER DOCUMENTATION -> Notice all the triggers to bind to! -> https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj2/command/button/CommandXboxController.
  
  
  ### Final requirements
  - you will show a completed lesson folder to your teacher. 
    - by branching this git repository and updating your own branch. 
    - or showing your laptop to a mentor!
    - The Project should always "Build successful" When shown to mentor unless asking a question during developement!
  
  ### Task to pass this lesson:
  
  1. Look at ALL the comments (green text) in Robot.java and look for a commented out print command object. this object wont be created if its commented out. uncomment it now. If you Simulate your code did anything operate different before and after this change?  Notice that you need the proper imports at the top the page? import those now try using quickfix or import frc.robot.commands.ExampleCommand;
  
  2. (viewed by Mentor): uncomment the bindings for the print command to the controller and will run the "example command" from the commands folder when teleop is enabled and the A button is pressed OR the smartdashboard button is pressed. Save and simulate again. Notice that you need the proper imports at the top the page? import those now try using quickfix or import frc.robot.commands.ExampleCommand;
    - YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO VIEW THE OUTPUT IN THE TERMINAL IN VSCODE
  
  
  - for lessons that require code changes there is a github branch "lessonSolutions" where you can find 1 possible way to pass pass the task, though there are MANY 
  way to approach each problem.  but the best option is to look at the WPIlib resources linked above and read about the topic at hand.
