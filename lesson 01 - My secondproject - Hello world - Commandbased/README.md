Lesson 01
Lets take a look at the most basic command based robot possible. 
and lets see how it builds upon the timed skeleton and runs the command scheduler and runs the auto through the scheduler. 


this guide is just a rewriting of the 100% awesome WPILIB docs! please just read the zero to robot section and you wont even need a mentor! 

the implied 8608 resource is this lesson 01- lesson plan  coming soon
if you have no mentor read the wpilib here and replicate this source code on your own! https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/index.html
start at step 2 and move forward if you are not using another lesson from the internet or a mentor
