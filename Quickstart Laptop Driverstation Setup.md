This is a quick setup list for making your laptop/PC ready to be an FRC driverstation simulator or connect to a Romi or XRP robot.
## hardware requirements

 - laptop or desktop from sometime recent (2016+). Most of our examples and guides expect a windows and not mac but mac is compatible with all components of FRC 
    
-   Get and xbox controller, logitech controller, or any usb xinput controller for windows
## programming requirements
-   Install your coding environment to a windows PC following these steps [https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)

-   the driverstation we will need to install the Ni game tools. follow the WPi libs instructions to install the NI game tools [https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html)
## 1st Code - (Built in Simulator with Mentors checking work)
- Any FRC code can be simulated! just load up a project folder in Vscode and press F5 to start debugging! you may need to open the driverstation and press "use driverstation" at the top. click ok and the simulation will open a window showing all robot data.
- in VScode you will be using your "terminal" or "console"(default bottom of screen) many times to read the text output from your robot! this is how your robot will send messages to you so pay attention for errors!
- in VScode click file->open folder and open any lesson folders included in this jgarder lesson github repository. read the green text in the robotcontainer.java these are mentor comments and information about the lesson and the task you need to complete! most of programming is understanding what you are reading. 

- CONTROLLER SETUP!!! -> if you simulate without the driverstation you will need to drag your xbox controller from the "joystick inputs" to the joystick[0] when inside the simulator! if you use the driverstation then just plugging in anycontroller will assign it to port 0! great job!

## 1st Code - (ONLY IF YOU HAVE REAL ROBOT)    
-    Connect to the FRC robot Using your computer, connect to the FRC robot WiFi network using the SSID OU NAMED in the robo rio. There should be no password to this network.
    
- Create your first project and move your robot by doing these steps : [https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-4/creating-test-drivetrain-program-cpp-java-python.html](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-4/creating-test-drivetrain-program-cpp-java-python.html)
