This is a quick setup list for making your laptop ready to be an FRC driverstation or connect to a Romi or XRP robot. 

0. For programming you will need to download github desktop but this is just for 8608 learning with mentors. 

1. Get laptop with atleast dual core, wifi 6 (for new radio) and 4 gb of ram, windows 10 1366x768 min resolution
2. Get and xbox controller or logitech controller or any usb xinput controller for windows
3. Install your coding environment to a windows PC following these steps https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html

4. the driverstation we will need to install the Ni game tools. follow the WPi libs instructions to install the NI game tools

5 (if using a real robot).Connect to the FRC robot Using your computer, 
 connect to the  FRC robot WiFi network using the SSID you NAMED in the robo rio. 
There should be no password to this network. 

5 ( if using simulator). boot up vs code and open a template or example project. press f5 to simulate the code. 

6 (on real robot). Create your first project and move your robot by doing these steps :
