// Open Robotcontainer.java for the core of your code! and most task!
/*
 * FRC #8608 "a dummies guide to programming FRC java"
 *
 * this guide is just a rewriting of the 100% awesome WPILIB docs!
 * please just read the zero to robot section and you wont even need a mentor!
 * in this lesson we will also be using the barebone skeleton advantage kit for a logging demonstration.
 *
 * Advantage Kit Version used : v4.1.2 (for Robo Rio)
 * 
 * references when in trouble (READ THE ADVANTAGE KIT WEBSITE):
 * -> https://docs.advantagekit.org/
 * -> https://docs.advantagekit.org/data-flow/recording-outputs/
 * -> https://docs.advantagekit.org/data-flow/recording-outputs/annotation-logging
 *
 * Lesson 104c - ADVANTAGEKIT Dashboard Info And debug text
 *
 * you will show a completed lesson folder to your teacher.
 * -> by branching this in git and updating your branch.
 * -> or showing them your personal laptop ready to compile/run or simulate your code!
 * -> The Project should always "Build successful" When shown to a mentor unless asking a question during developement!
 *
 * requirements to pass this lesson:
 *
 * Task 0 : Run the code in the simulator and observe the results. there should be some whole number (int) variables that are incrementing, you should be able to see these variables changing in the dashboard, or the sim GUI, or in advantagescope.
 *
 * Task 1 (viewed by Mentor):
 * make a int variable and then log it using annotation logging (see the link above)
 * the int variable that you just made should now be incremented (added too) in periodic.
 * now show the variable in advantagescope or the elastic dashboard.
 *
 * Task 2 (viewed by mentor):
 * do the same as above (create a variable and increment it) but do NOT annotation log it, instead use the logger to record the output. show the incrementing variable in the dashboard or advantagekit to your mentor.
