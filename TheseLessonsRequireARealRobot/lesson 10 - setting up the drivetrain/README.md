Lesson 0

Setting up the drivetrain and configuring the swerve.

we use a template swerve provided by CTRE for 2024 since the actual math involved in coding from scratch is a little complex for our robotics team at this point.
for the exact template we are using a phoenix 6 example from ctre  here --> https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix6-Examples

this guide is just a rewriting of the 100% awesome WPILIB docs! please just read the zero to robot section and you wont even need a mentor! 

the implied 8608 resource is this lesson 0- lesson plan https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sl6URFDPsmlhQR07-JDx-zExLEvWftC0/
if you have no mentor read the wpilib here and replicate this source code on your own! https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/index.html
start at step 2 and move forward if you are not using another lesson from the internet or a mentor
