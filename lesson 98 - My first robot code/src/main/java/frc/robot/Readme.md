/* Open Robot.java This will be the core of your times robot (we use robotcontainer later)
 /*
 * FRC #8608 "a dummies guide to programming FRC java"
 * 
 * this guide is just a rewriting of the 100% awesome WPILIB docs! 
 * please just read the zero to robot section and you wont even need a mentor! 
 * 
 * Wpilib references when in trouble :
 * -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/creating-robot-program.html#timedrobot
 * 
 * lesson 0 - hello world and the basic Timed robot skeleton
 * 
 * you will show a completed lesson folder to your teacher. 
 * -> by branching this in git and updating your branch. 
 * -> or showing them your personal laptop ready to compile/run or simulate your code!
 * -> The Project should always "Build successful" When shown to mentor unless asking a question during developement!
 * requirements to pass this lesson:
 * 
 * Task 0 : Look at ALL the comments (green text) below and learn what functions/methods run 
 *  when  autonomous/teleoperated is turned on, when auton/teleop is running periodically, and when auto/teleOp are disabled. 
 * 
 * Task 1 : (in vsCode) in the top menu click run-> start debugging, OR press f5, OR ctl-shift-P -> simulate robot code
 *  the project builds then 2 options at top of screen will appear. check them both (sim Gui and Use real driverstation)
 *  you should now have the simulation window come up, you will need to run the driverstation.
 *  -> view in the terminal the print outs that are executing. this is at the bottom of vscode (with a real robot also in the driverstation).
 * 
 * Task 2 (viewed by Mentor): Add a print out that will say "running during periodic" when teleop is enabled. and not print when disabled.
 *  - YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO VIEW THE OUTPUT IN THE TERMINAL IN VSCODE (with a real robot also in the driverstation)
 * 
 * at any time you can also check the github branch "lessonSolutions" to see how the mentors intend you to pass the task, though there are MANY 
 * way to achieve each problem.  but the best option is to look at the WPIlib resources linked above and read about the topic at hand.
 * 
 * Goodluck, getting this setup is a giant hurdle. after this you can mess with things and just enjoy the enviroment, maybe expand your knowledge (if you want)
