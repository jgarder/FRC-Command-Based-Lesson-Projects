// Open Robotcontainer.java for the core of your code! and most task!
/*
 * FRC #8608 "a dummies guide to programming FRC java"
 * 
 * this guide is just a rewriting of the 100% awesome WPILIB docs! 
 * please just read the zero to robot section and you wont even need a mentor! 
 * 
 * Wpilib references when in trouble :
 * -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/dashboards/smartdashboard/displaying-status-of-commands-and-subsystems.html
 * -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/writing-sendable-classes.html#writing-your-own-sendable-classes
 * -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/wpilib-tools/robotbuilder/introduction/robotbuilder-testing-with-shuffleboard.html
 * ->https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/robot-telemetry-with-sendable.html
 * 
 * Lesson 5 - Dashboard Info And debug text
 * Dashboard information and sendable interactions.
 * Note : sendables only work in test most for the livewindow. its a hassle honestly. we will use smartdashboard. 

 * you will show a completed lesson folder to your teacher. 
 * -> by branching this in git and updating your branch. 
 * -> or showing them your personal laptop ready to compile/run or simulate your code!
 * -> The Project should always "Build successful" When shown to a mentor unless asking a question during developement!
 * 
 * requirements to pass this lesson:
 *
 * Task 0 : Run the code in the simulator and observe the results. then run the robot in test most and veiw the changes to the dashboard and the available debugging data (this is advanced and not needed for basic robot construction)

 * 
 * Task 1 (viewed by Mentor):
