Lesson 4 - subclassing commands and subclassing composition and perhaps a simple command factory

This lesson we will take lesson 3 and spend most of the effort just moving all codes to subclasses and a command factory outside of robotcontainer. 


we will mainly be using the WPILib code compositon! please read all this and become a pro -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/command-compositions.html#subclassing-compositions
this guide is just a rewriting of the 100% awesome WPILIB docs! please just read the "Organizing command based programming" section and you wont even need a mentor! 

the implied 8608 resource is this lesson 4 lesson plan -> N/A yet! coming soon!
if you have no mentor read the wpilib here and replicate this source code on your own! -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/organizing-command-based.html
