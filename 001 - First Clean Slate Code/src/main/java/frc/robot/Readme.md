  #### lesson 001 - First Clean Slate Robot
  
  This guide is just a rewriting of the 100% awesome WPILIB docs! 
  please just read the zero to robot section on docs.wpilib.org and you wont even need a mentor! 

  #### WpiLib refereces used:
  -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/creating-robot-program.html#timedrobot
  
  
  ### Grading requirements
  - you will show a completed lesson folder to your teacher. 
    - by branching this git repository and updating your own branch. 
    - or showing your laptop to a mentor!
    - The Project should always "Build successful" When shown to mentor unless asking a question during developement!
  
  ### Lesson Task:
  
  1. (In VSCode open Robot.java) Look at ALL the comments (green text) in Robot.java and learn what functions(i.e methods) will "run" when  autonomous/teleoperated is turned initialized (init)<br><br>
  
  2. (in vsCode) We need to start debugging, we can do this a few ways
     - Use CTRL-SHIFT-P > Simulate robot code
     - in the top menu click run > start debugging, 
     - OR press f5 to start debugging 
  3. The project will build, then 2 SMALL options at top middle of screen will appear. check sim Gui and press OK
    - view the terminal at the bottom of the VSCODE screen. The printouts you see here are is the system.out.println() that are executing.<br><br>
  
4. (viewed by Mentor): find the method that executes or "runs" when the robot is disabled. uncomment the  system.out.print out that will say "Robot now Disabled" when the robot is disabled. 
   - AFTER RESTARTING THE SIMULATION YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO VIEW THE OUTPUT IN THE TERMINAL IN VSCODE
  
  - for lessons that require code changes there is a github branch "lessonSolutions" where you can find 1 possible way to pass pass the task, though there are MANY 
  way to approach each problem.  but the best option is to look at the WPIlib resources linked above and read about the topic at hand.
  
  Goodluck, getting this setup is a giant hurdle. after this you can mess with things and just enjoy the enviroment, maybe expand your knowledge (if you want)
